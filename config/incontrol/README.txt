It's impossible to cleanly add comments to JSON, so I'll use this file for that.

Most overworld/space hostile mobs are completely disabled.
Endermen only inhabit the end (you're gonna have to buy perals from villagers to get there). 

All mobs that are bound to structures still spawn, even those that are disabled.

Currently, loots are tweaked using CraftTweaker, but this may change in the future.
